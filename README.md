### I try to write algorithms to solve some mathematical problems. I got the problems from projecteuler.net .
## EvenFibonacciNums
- The solven problem is "By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."
## LargestPrimeFactor
- The solven problem is "What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?"
## largestPalindromeProduct
- A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The solven problem is "Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers."
